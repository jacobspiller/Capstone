-Make sure flash is configured properly
-Make BLE work
-create function to pull desired angles from ble packets
-implement kinematics -> see arm dimensions image, **inverse kinematics**
-implement control system (PID) -> see flowchart
-implement IMU data conversion(quaternion?)
-figure out i2c whoami issue where register read is incorrect value (received 0xF8 instead of 0xA9)
-create pwm functions
-create interupt for ble connection (max 4sec interval)
-create function to reset arm to neutral position
